# 1. Intro

Two primary goals:

1. Clearly specify all of the actual 2.0 release Must-Haves in one place
  * Settle debates about requirements separately from/prior to design/code issues
  * Get a more complete picture of the real scope and the effort needed
  * Optional/nice-to-have/future requirements flagged as "[2.1]", regardless of any actual future version that might incorporate that requirement
  * "[?]" = still needs version goal...  
  * No version flag = Must-Have!
  * Many of the major new requirements were previously discussed in Git issue #1755, best to review that first...

2. Enumerate as many as possible of the relevant pre-existing, broken, in-progress, and future features and requirements that should (where practical) be accommodated and/or anticipated by the new architectural design (see Design Goals below).
   
<tl;dr> 

Punchline: given the available Rajawali dev resources, many/most of the "cool new" API features and even some existing features (and bug fixes) should be postponed in favor of building a robust and extensible architectural foundation on which those features can be incrementally implemented (or fixed and re-enabled) in future releases (as pure extensions) with little/no impact to the to-be-released Camden Hells API...

</tl;dr>

For reviews and updates:
  * Camden Hells Milestone issues in GitHub are called out where available. e.g. "(#1755)"
  * This is a living document; try to keep it updated in Git as agreements about reqs and priorities evolve up to and through the 2.0 release timeframe (and immediate follow-on fixes). Start a new 2.1 reqs doc after that... 
    * [Any "D" beer name for 2.1 yet? :sunglasses: ]
  * "Help!" and "?" mean "open/unresolved requirement issue, feel free to scope things out more fully/correctly, or delete" (please ~~strike-through~~ until delete is agreed); need to resolve/elaborate if 2.0...
  * Don't worry/comment about grammar or spelling, just improve at will if desired
  * Try to keep design decisions and details out except as examples and likely possibilities; place actual hard design decisions in DESIGN.md and/or code as appropriate and convenient... 
  * Careful about section/header/list numbers, they're manual, not automatic!

## 1.1 Terms

  * CH = the Rajawali Camden Hells (2.0) release being specified here
  * Engine = the Rajawali API and/or its implementation

# 2. System Requirements

1. Minimum Android OS version is SDK 19 (KitKat 4.4)
  * 15 is no longer supported with Google security updates
  * 19+ covers 90% of the distributed versions as of 08/2017
  * Should reduce on-going support load for older/more limited hardware
  * May increase opportunities for integrating other libraries
2. Support OpenGL ES versions 2.0, 3.0 (#665), 3.1, and 3.2
  * Support for a GL ES version:
    * Does not imply support for the entirety of that version's API
    * Does imply that engine features available in earlier versions are still available
  * Using an engine feature that depends on a version greater than is available on a device:
    * Will in general throw a runtime exception. 
    * Should be avoided by the application by checking versions first, or by manifest declarations
  * Using an engine feature that depends on a version less than is available on a device:
    * May automatically use a different implementation using the newer GL ES API features
    * Should in general only happen if it improves (or at least does not reduce) performance

# 3. Functional Requirements

## 3.1 Android and OpenGL ES integration

1. Provide (major and minor) version query for the current GL ES render context
2. Decouple Android views from the EGL context to allow offline rendering/initialization
3. Allow multiple `GlSurfaceViews` per Activity ? [2.1]
    * Multiple render contexts can exist at once on some devices. Additionally, with some creative APIs, a single renderer could drive multiple SurfaceView/TextureView implementations.
    * E.g. `ViewPager` support (per #1619)
    * Is timing of render context switch still based on window attachment?
4. Wallpaper surface view multisampling fix (#1559)
5. Provide query/configuration constants (bit flags) for all Vendor GL ES extensions (#1742) [2.1]
  * CH implementation will include this for all texture extensions.
  * Requires native code and will be provided as part of the core library for integration reasons.
  
## 3.2 Scene Models and Views

### 3.2.1. Model files
 
1. Assimp support
 * Implemented as a separate module which will interface to `core` via a Java interface.

  * Texture mapping/screen quads
3. Add `Quaternion.squad()` (#1737) [2.1]

### 3.2.4 Scene Views 

Provide separate specification of a rendered view for a scene model. Each scene view specifies:
1. Its scene model - mutable
2. One camera, switchable, and a dynamic set of any number/mix of lights
  * No inherent geometry/vertex data
  * Embedded in the scene, transformable 
  * World coordinates can be queried
  * "Containers", optional visualization geometries for debugging or app functions can be added
  * Switch between whole light sets at once ? [2.1]
3. Skybox texture/bitmaps and size, and/or background color and/or materials; all mutable
  * Add an equirectangular/radial mapped skysphere geometry
  * Add equirectangular/radial environment mapping so we can continue to share textures between both sky geometry and environment mapping.
4. Target/viewport rectangle size and on-screen location (subsumes #1752)
5. Depth mask/stencil [2.1]
6. AR integration [2.1]

  * E.g. use cases:
    * Debugging (#1436)
    * Interactive camera/lighting selections from a global-view PIP inset 
    * Theater/stage lighting design apps
    * Interior design apps - door/window/furniture/light placements

### 3.2.5 Future scene/object stuff [2.1]

1. Terrain generation (#905)
2. Skeletal/vertex animation callbacks (#895)
3. Modifiers (e.g. Bend a plane) (#652)
4. Advanced object (affine transform) animations?

  * Animating (dynamic, sparse) groups of objects
5. Advanced gesture support
  * Implemented as a separate module which utilizes a core interface.

    * Streamed 3D object catalog display with "recycler"-style selection
    * Parallel/independent storylines/settings
    * Analytics dashboards with interactive 3D graphs

    * Multiple cameras - forward, left, right, rear, top, follow, etc.
    * Global/context map inset/PIP
    * Day vs night comparisons (side-by-side or PIP)
    * Natural vs artificial lighting (e.g. infra-red, UV, or other color-mapping) comparisons
    * Stereo VR left-right eyes/lenses; Cardboard
  * Scene view depth order can use simple back-to-front painter's algorithm
    * Performance impacts of overwrites is application responsibility for now
    * Overall surface view background color
      * Defaults to black
      * Can be overridden
      * Can be turned off if not needed
3. Multiple frame renders per scene view
  * Example enabled use cases
    * Normal/default on-screen rendering to the scene view's viewport location
    * Off-screen functions
      * Object picking and other application logic using e.g. pixel buffer queries
      * Bitmap images for application frame captures and debugging 
  * All frame renders use the (same) scene view's render target/viewport size
  * Zero or one frame render to the on-screen viewport 
    * Location constrained so that entire viewport is always within the 3D surface view
    * Can be hidden/temporarily removed from screen
      * Surface view background color can be specified (in case no other scene views are behind)
    * Can disable frame updates, independent of hiding
  * Any number of frame renders to readable off-screen image buffers
4. Multiple render targets per framebuffer (#1862)
  * E.g. for deferred lighting and ambient occlusion g-buffers
  * All attachments per render target are the same size (resolution).
 Â * Different storage formats per attachment are supported per framebuffer.
  * Not all combinations are required to be supported, but at a minimum all _color format_ combinations are. If an unsupported combination is specified, `GL_FRAMEBUFFER_UNSUPPORTED` will be generated.
5. Multiple (sub-)passes per render pass/framebuffer
  * E.g. for post-processing effects
  * Same framebuffer for all sub-passes
6. Multiple iterations for a specific sub-pass/sub-pass sequence
  * E.g. lens flare sprites, blurs
7. Multiple draws per sub-pass
  * E.g. per object
8. Multiple render passes per frame render
  * E.g. for shadow map creation vs use
  * Different sized targets/framebuffers

### 3.3.2 Pipeline programs and fixed functions

* Bumps/Parallax from height maps (#573) [2.1]

## 3.4 Performance Optimization Requirements

### 3.4.1 CPU and GPU Resources

1. Avoid unnecessary GL ES API calls to reduce CPU-GPU bus bottlenecks
  * E.g. track render context state to filter higher-frequency calls
2. Exploit GL ES API efficiency mechanisms where available and worthwhile, e.g.:
  * Interleaved vertex attribute buffer data - postion, normal, color (#773)
  * Uniform buffer objects (#1861) 
  * Program pipeline objects    
3. RenderScript (#633) [2.1]
     
### 3.4.2 Memory Resources
  
1. Minimize allocations/enable re-use of memory resources where worthwhile, e.g. caching, pooling, and sharing of:
  * Client (Java/native C++) objects
    * Object geometries
    * Material specs
    * Vectors/matrices/quaternions (#1224)
  * Server (render context/GPU) objects
    * Program/shader sources/binaries
    * Source/sample textures
      * Fix memory leaks (#1801, #1805)
    * Render target `RenderBuffer` and `Texture2D` image buffers
  * Persistence scopes
    * Per App ? [2.1]
      * Store/load caches across processes
      * E.g. program binaries
    * Per Process
      * Restore GPU resources from client data shared across context switches due to:
        * Activity/Fragment lifecycles
        * `SurfaceView` window attachments (#1619)
      * E.g. vertex data buffers, textures, program/shader sources, uniform buffers
      * Per resource instance, allow restoration or recycling/deletion at restore time
        * Fix COW collection removal bug #1973
    * Per `SurfaceView` window attachment (render thread/render context/`Renderer`)
      * Render target image buffers used as framebuffer attachments
    * Per Scene model - no memory resources
    * Per Scene view - no memory resources
    * Per frame render and render pass
      * Allow use of over-size image buffers for smaller framebuffers 
2. Re-add `short` index buffers (#1816)

### 3.4.3 Data structures and algorithms

Some of these reqs could also be considered functional, but are only feasible if based on a sufficiently performant implementation and so listed here.   

1. Scene model graphs/trees
  * Enable simpler/faster culling for frame renders
  * Maintain current hierarchical parent-child affine transformations (local frame)
    * Enable parent tracking in child (#1751)
  * Enable future optimized functions [2.1], e.g.:
    * Collision detection (#1477)
    * Ray picking (#259)
    * Fractal instancing
    * "Infinite" order-of-magnitude zooming
  * Flat tree [2.0], quad tree [2.1], oct tree [2.1] 
2. Enable/disable frame renders per scene view
3. Z-order sorting - opaque, front to back (#789, #1236). [2.1]
  * Sorting of transparent objects in an automated fashion in 3D real time graphics is an open problem worthy of a PhD to any who solve it.
4. Deferred lighting [2.1]

## 3.5 Interoperability Requirements

Where supported by the device and the GL ES API and not logically opposed, all functional and performance optimization requirements should:
  * Be simultaneously availble
  * Operate without functional conflicts
  
This does not preclude performance impacts; clearly there will be limits, but hardware keeps getting better/cheaper and we want to be able to take advantage of that without a lot of future rework...

## 3.6 Concurrency and Synchronization

### 3.6.1 Enable render thread safety
  * No public API fields; provide accessors
  * Document implicit default thread assumptions 
    * E.g. render thread-only (not safe) unless otherwise specified
  * Mark explicit thread-safety per type and/or per method (overriding type), e.g. using annotations
  * App responsible for observing thread safety markers
    * Enforcement provided by debug-only assertions (see below)

### 3.6.2  Simplify basic thread communication

  * Main/UI and other threads -> Render thread
    * Make it easy to post/queue message/events to the render thread
    * E.g. UI input, network, sensor, IO, and app model events sourced on any thread
  * Render thread -> Main/UI thread 
    * Make it easy to post/queue messages/events to the main/UI thread
    * Provide queueing variants of frame, animation, and transaction (see below) callbacks
  * Render thread -> Other threads
    * Is app responsibility!

### 3.6.3 Provide transactional CRUD operations on overall render state

1. Enable app-level consistency (if properly used)
  * Allow any combination/granularity of operations on arbitrary subsets of the combined (Rajawali plus OpenGL ES) render-state
    * I.e. read and/or write any/all properties of scenes/graphs, scene views
  * All writes (Create/Updates/Deletes) in the same transaction:
    * Guaranteed to take effect as a group
    * Prior to the next render thread event (including other CRUD transactions)
  * Similar to current initScene(), but available whenever the render context is valid
2. Ensure specialized "ACID" semantics
  * Atomic - across combined state:
    * All layers of resources, including Rajawali Java/C++ instances and GL ES state
    * Either (atomic) success, or throw (runtime?/error?) exceptions if not possible
  * Consistent - internally 
    * Leave combined state operational, no crashes/exceptions
    * But no visual consistency guarantees, app responsibility
  * Isolated - from all (other) render thread/event processing
    * Frame draws, window re-sizes, queued events, other CRUD transactions, etc.
    * Implies running on the render thread as an event, queued from any thread
    * Queued transactions after window detach/loss of context are dropped
  * Durable - process persistence scope
    * Combined state preserved across Activities and render contexts
    * Essentially a requirement to provide automatic restores
3. Provide "successful completion" callback
  * Provide a variant that includes queueing to main/UI thread (see above)

# 4. Testing, Validation, and Debugging Requirements

## 4.1 Source code

  * Consistently specify any constraints on all member and parameter values
    * Specify all references as either nullable or non-null
    * Specify integer and float ranges whenever less than built-in language limits

## 4.2 Unit Tests

  * Automated build-time unit test harnesses:
    * For off-device Java-only methods
    * For on-device methods requiring an active GL context
  * For all public API and internal interface methods
    * Includes those:
      * With simple single-instance "black-box" behaviors, and
      * With few/no dependencies on other components, and
      * With relatively little local history dependence (simple setup)
      * Whose success can be determined as value assertions
      * E.g. contructors, simple get/set accessors, deterministic functions/transforms
    * Excluding those:
      * With significant history/event dependencies or behavioral states, and/or
      * Whose success cannot be (at least partially) reasonably determined as value assertions (i.e. non-visual)
      * E.g. frame draws, client callbacks

## 4.3 Integration tests

  * Automated build-time integration test harness
    * Utilize standard Android test instrumentation tooling
  * For primarily sequential use cases/control flows:
    * With minimal interactions with/dependencies on other components
    * Whose success can be verified non-visually
    * E.g. scene graph population changes and affine transformations
  * For selected example apps [2.1]
    * List TBD
    * E.g. enable visual output validation by comparison with known good screen grabs per hardware configuration

## 4.3 Deployment

  * Enable local deployment to facilitate development testing and debugging (#1982)
  
## 4.3. Run-time

For engine and app development and integration testing, and for debugging support issues

1. Provide unified logging
  * The usual levels - verbose, debug, info, warning, error, wtf
  * All messages should identify the class and method
  * Core engine/rendering component (scenes, scene view, render pass, etc.) messages should also identify the instance
  * All warning and error messages should include specific causes and data values if appropriate
  * All error messages should be accompanied by a thrown runtime exception
2. Provide verbose-level method tracing messages 
  * For key lifecycle event (create/init/start/run/pause/stop/destroy etc.) handlers of engine/rendering components
    * Includes all active components: scenes, scene views, render passes, etc.
    * Does not include passive model objects, textures, resources 
  * Tracing dynamically enabled per instance; disabled by default  
3. Use logging and trace messaging judiciously to avoid excessive performance impacts or major frame delays
  * Comment out or delete developmental log messages when no longer needed
  * Avoid frame-rate messages (except as temporary developmental aids to be deleted/commented out before checkins)
    * E.g. accumulate/integrate/summarize any per-frame data, and log e.g. once per second or so
4. API and internal interface usage validation
  * Assert method contracts
    * Log violations as warnings or errors (with thrown runtime exceptions) as noted below
    * Debug-mode checks:
      * Input parameters for all public API methods and all internal interface methods (error)
      * Instance state for lifecycle event handlers, e.g. animation start, scene view render (error)
      * Thread for non-thread-safe methods (error)
    * Release-mode checks:
      * Render context version and render control state (error)
      * Render context (GL) resources, if recoverable (warning)
        * E.g. failed shader compilation, invalid VBO handles are recoverable
5. Except for release-mode assertions, strip all logging, tracing, and assertion code from release builds
    * Remove code rather than simply using conditional runtime checks
    * E.g. using Proguard or compiler optimizations

# 5. Modularity Requirements

  * Identify and implement separate library modules for optional/lower-frequency features [2.1]
    * Core module vs add-ons (list TBD):
      * VR 
      * AR
      * Modifiers, animations, rendering effects
      * Font-to-texture
      * Gestures
      * Wear
      * TV?
      * Wallpaper
  * Always provide all-in-one module in addition to core plus add-on modules
  * Publish debug/development flavor in addition to release flavor of each module
    * Simplify app access to/visibility of engine-internal logging/tracing
    * Snapshot builds will include debug/development modules only
    * Tagged versions will include both release and debug modules

# 6. Usage Documentation Requirements

1. JavaDocs
  * All public API types and methods
  * Non-obvious protected types. methods, and fields
  * Add JavaDocs publishing to build
2. Examples App
  * Per significant feature
    * Basic use case, not every variation
    * Multiple features per example OK
  * At a minimum;
    * Basic hello-world
    * GL debugging
    * Basic materials
    * Color picking
    * Basic affine animations
    * Collision detection
    * Skybox
    * Directional, positional, and spot lights
    * OBJ model loader
    * Bloom effect
    * Shadow mapping
    * Basic multiple scenes/scene views
    * Dynamic (transactional) updates
    * UI elements
  * Enable automatic updates to AppStore
    * We definitely need this. We used to get a lot of traffic from the AppStore
3. Wiki Guideline .md docs
  * Major impact to content; new and refactored guides needed
  * At a minimum:
    * Installation guide
    * Scene, scene graph, and scene view basics
    * Materials & lighting basics
    * Loader basics
    * Skybox 
    * Affine animation basics
  * Complete migration to `docs` folder (#1633)

# 7. Design Goals and Constraints

## 7.1 Code consistency

Define and apply engine-wide naming, packaging, and coding conventions
  * Base on a widely-accepted existing set
    * E.g. start with [Google's Java style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
  * Override/add Rajawali specifics, including:
    * Eliminate Hungarian notation (#1581)
  
## 7.2 Architectural stability and extensibility

1. Favor the SOLID paradigm for OO design (especially for new code):
  * Single responsibility principle
    * Separate concerns to maximize functional cohesion and reduce couplings between modules, e.g. models vs views
    * Use chains/trees of responsibility, e.g. distribute/delegate rendering to a hierarchy of rendering components
  * Open/closed principle
    * Use abstract types (base classes and interfaces)
    * Extend them as needed (directly or by inheritance)
    * Avoid modifying them; when unavoidable, use formal deprecations
  * Liskov substitution principle
    * Avoid changing the observable state or behavior of a type in one of its subtypes
  * Interface segregation principle
    * Use more, smaller, role-specific interfaces rather than fewer, larger, multi-role interfaces
    * Specifically, use separate interfaces for public APIs vs engine internals
  * Dependency inversion principle
    * Use interfaces to access lower-level components from higher-level components 
    * Focus is on simplifying dynamic (re-)configuration, but could be also be useful for unit testing
    * Applications act as simple dependency injectors for the engine
2. Anticipate support for Vulkan 1.0
  * Eventual goal is for app compatibility across Vulkan and OpenGL ES devices
  * Identify/exploit common abstractions, e.g. render pass and sub-pass
  * Define formal GLES/Vulkan hinge points/substitutions, e.g. GPU resource allocations
  * A primary driver for use of SOLID principles, but no actual Vulkan API use yet!
3. Plan for incrementally incorporating/exploiting the bulk of the graphics system APIs over time
  * Reflect actual graphics APIs, wrap/delegate API abstractions directly
  * E.g. use Facades, stub in unused aspects when planned, implement when needed
  
## 7.3 Compatibility
  
1. NO requirement for backward compatibility of engine API types, methods, signatures, names, etc.
  * In general, expect much of the API to be impacted and to re-code existing apps accordingly
2. Maintain basic feature parity with prior versions
  * Explicitly document (here ? in DESIGN.md ?) any features working in 0.9 or 1.x that will be:
    * Postponed to later revisions, or
    * Dropped altogether for the foreseeable future    
3. Enable backward compatibility in all future engine releases
  * Plan for formal API deprecations
