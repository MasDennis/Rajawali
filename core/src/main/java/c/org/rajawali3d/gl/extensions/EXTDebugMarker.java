/**
 * This extension defines a mechanism for OpenGL and OpenGL ES applications to annotate their command stream with
 * markers for discrete events and groups of commands using descriptive text markers.
 *
 * When profiling or debugging such an application within a debugger or profiler it is difficult to relate the
 * commands within the command stream to the elements of the scene or parts of the program code to which they
 * correspond. Markers help obviate this by allowing applications to specify this link.
 *
 * The intended purpose of this is purely to improve the user experience within OpenGL and OpenGL ES development tools.
